# Generalized-Linear-Model-
 A Statistical Analysis of Data from a Clinical Trial


The aim of this report is to provide a statistical analysis of the data from a clinical trial that will help study the effect of the clotting agent concentration on the time taken for blood to clot.

We first explore the given data-set and then we try determine the relationship between clotting time and concentration, by fitting two types of models. The first model is the suggested by the team normal linear model. We review the required assumptions, evaluate the fit and discuss the limitations when using this method. Then we propose a gamma generalised linear model (GLM), explain how it works and why it is more appropriate for the given data and describe our findings in detail.
